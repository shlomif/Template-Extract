Revision history for perl module Template::Extract

0.50   2024-09-08

    * Hopefully fix the CPAN installation in bleadperl after removing singlequote as a
      package separator
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=155310

    * Add the ability to use a structured var (with "dots")
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46645
      Thanks to LTHEGLER

0.41   2007-10-16

    * LICENSING CHANGE: This compilation and all individual files in it
      are now under the permissive "MIT" license.

    * Tidied up source code and test files.

0.40   2005-09-17

    * Support for capturing matched regular expressions into variables,
      Contributed by "woremacx".  For example, this captures an nonempty
      header text into the "heading" variable:

        <h2>[% heading =~ /((?!<\/h2).+?)/ %]</h2>

0.39   2005-07-15

    * Allow passing Template::Parser options directly into
      Template::Extract->new().  Suggested by brian d foy.

    * Factored out the parser into Template::Extract::Parser to
      allow use of alternate parsers with the PARSE_CLASS class method.

0.38   2004-10-25

    * Fix test failure with pre-5.8.4's regex optimizer.
      Reported by CPAN testers.

0.37   2004-10-20

    * Move under SVK for version management.
    * If the template ends with a capturing variable, make it
      greedy instead of nongreedy, so it won't always match the
      empty string.  Reported by LTJake on IRC.

0.36   2004-02-16

    * Separate the compilation and run parts into two
      modules, for ease of deployment (::Run may be put
      on a machine without TT2) and marginally faster
      execution.  Suggested by Bruno De Fraine.

0.35   2004-01-09

    * Fixes regression caused by newer TT2 versions,
      which adds the extra "#line" directives into the
      regular expressions.  Spotted by Yi-Ming Cao
      and Sam Smith.

    * Implement suggestion from Luis Oliveira: embedded
      non-capturing regexes, such as [% /\s*/ %].

    * Add implicit optional newlines around [% FOREACH %]
      blocks, so it can intuitively work.

0.33   2003-12-13

    * Adds MANIFEST.SKIP that takes care of Module::Build
      files, so older versions of Module::Build/MakeMaker
      won't trip Module::Signature over.  Thanks to CPAN
      smoker Jost Krieger for the report.

0.32   2003-12-13

    * Improved build intrastructure, suggested by Mark Fowler,
      to automatically check and download nmake.exe on Windows,
      as well as supporting a Module::Build-compatible Build.PL.

    * Clarify documents; add links to Simon and Mark's articles.

0.31   2003-10-21

    * New flag $EXACT to control whether partial documents
      should match. (defaults to 0 for backward compatibility)

    * Tatsuhiko Miyagawa pointed out that [% FOREACH %] blocks
      fail to match prematurely because it can match zero times.
      Now outermost foreach blocks must match at least once.

0.30   2003-10-20

    * This module is no longer experimental. :)
    * Russell Matbouli reports that extract did not properly
      set \%values.  Fixed.
    * [% SET key = "value" %] now works inside FOREACHs.
    * [% SET nested.key = "value" %] now works.
    * Much more robust validating code inside FOREACHs.
    * Refactored the common context walking code from "get",
      "set" and "validate" into _ext, and improved readability.

0.25   2003-09-06

    * Kate L Pugh pointed out the _enter_loop construct
      was failing if there are more than one loops inside
      another loop, because the loop counter of the first
      loop inside was inadvertently reset to 0.  Fixed.

0.24   2003-09-02

    * Now Template::Generate is released, modify relevant PODs.
    * Unify nomenclature: ($data, $template, $document).
    * Some more style cleanup.

0.23   2003-09-02

    * No API changes, but seriously tidied up the internals.

0.22   2003-09-01

    * Properly handles backtracking, so two [% var %]s are
      guaranteed to match the same sequence.
    * Much more robust post-matching handlers, so the same variable
      matched at the same location (but are of different length)
      will not create a new item in the enclosing FOREACH array.

0.21   2003-09-01

    * Oops, left debug statements and "use YAML" in.

0.20   2003-08-31

    * [% nested.variable.name %] now works.
    * Nested [% FOREACH %] blocks now work.
    * Much more robust and readable DEBUG output.
    * Commented the code somewhat so it's at least grokkable.
    * Allow [%...%], [%  ...  %], or any other combination of
      \s characters (or lack thereof).

0.11   2003-08-30

    * Fix typo, documentation, tabs, spelling, tests, etc...

0.10   2003-08-30

    * Add manifest.
    * Refactored, cleaned up template extractor.
