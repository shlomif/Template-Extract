=head1 NAME

Template::Extract - Use TT2 syntax to extract data from documents

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.41 of Template::Extract, released
October 16, 2007.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Template::Extract;
    use Data::Dumper;

    my $obj = Template::Extract->new;
    my $template = << '.';
    <ul>[% FOREACH record %]
    <li><A HREF="[% url %]">[% title %]</A>: [% rate %] - [% comment %].
    [% ... %]
    [% END %]</ul>
    .

    my $document = << '.';
    <html><head><title>Great links</title></head><body>
    <ul><li><A HREF="http://slashdot.org">News for nerds.</A>: A+ - nice.
    this text is ignored.</li>
    <li><A HREF="http://microsoft.com">Where do you want...</A>: Z! - yeah.
    this text is ignored, too.</li></ul>
    .

    print Data::Dumper::Dumper(
        $obj->extract($template, $document)
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds template extraction functionality to the B<Template>
toolkit.  It can take a rendered document and its template together, and
get the original data structure back, effectively reversing the
C<Template::process> function.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(\%options)

Constructor.  Currently all options are passed into the underlying
C<Template::Parser> object.  The same set of options are also passed to classes
responsible to compile and run the extraction process, but they are currently
ignored.

=head2 extract($template, $document, \%values)

This method takes three arguments: the template string, or a reference to
it; a document string to match against; and an optional hash reference to
supply initial values, as well as storing the extracted values into.

The return value is C<\%values> upon success, and C<undef> on failure.
If C<\%values> is omitted from the argument list, a new hash reference
will be constructed and returned.

Extraction is done by transforming the result from B<Template::Parser>
to a highly esoteric regular expression, which utilizes the C<(?{...})>
construct to insert matched parameters into the hash reference.

The special C<[% ... %]> directive is taken as the C</.*?/s> regex, i.e.
I<ignore everything (as short as possible) between this identifier and
the next one>.  For backward compatibility, C<[% _ %]> and C<[% __ %]>
are also accepted.

The special C<[% // %]> directive is taken as a non-capturing regex,
embedded inside C</(?:)/s>; for example, C<[% /\d*/ %]> matches any
number of digits.  Capturing parentheses may not be used with this
directive, but you can use the C<[% var =~ // %]> directive to capture
the match into C<var>.

You may set C<$Template::Extract::DEBUG> to a true value to display
generated regular expressions.

The extraction process defaults to succeed even with a partial match.
To match the entire document only, set C<$Template::Extract::EXACT> to
a true value.

=head2 compile($template)

Use B<Template::Extract::Compile> to perform the first phase of
C<extract>, by returning the regular expression compiled from
C<$template>.

=head2 run($regex, $document, \%values)

Use B<Template::Extract::Run> to perform the second phase of
C<extract>, by applying the regular expression on C<$document>
and returning the resulting C<\%values>.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

If you would like to use different modules to parse, compile and run
the extraction process, simply subclass C<Template::Extract> and
override the C<COMPILE_CLASS>, C<PARSER_CLASS> and C<RUN_CLASS>
methods to return alternate class names.

=head1 CAVEATS

Currently, the C<extract> method only supports C<[% GET %]>,
C<[% SET %]> and C<[% FOREACH %]> directives, because C<[% WHILE %]>,
C<[% CALL %]> and C<[% SWITCH %]> blocks are next to impossible to
extract correctly.

C<[% SET key = "value" %]> only works for simple scalar values.

Outermost C<[% FOREACH %]> blocks must match at least once in the
document, but inner ones may occur zero times.  This is to prevent
the regex optimizer from failing prematurely.

There is no support for different I<PRE_CHOMP> and I<POST_CHOMP> settings 
internally, so extraction could fail silently on extra linebreaks.

It is somewhat awkward to use global variables to control C<EXACT> and C<DEBUG>
behaviour; patches welcome to promote them into per-instance options.

=head1 NOTES

This module's companion class, B<Template::Generate>, is still in early
experimental stages; it can take data structures and rendered documents,
then automagically generates templates to do the transformation. If you are
into related research, please mail any ideas to me.
